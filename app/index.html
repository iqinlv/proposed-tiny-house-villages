      <h3 class="headline headline--centered headline--blue headline--small">Areas Struggling to Adapt to Affordable Housing in Nevada</h3>
      <p>Nevada needs to start expanding the availability of affordable housing, we are hoping to gain legislation that aims to make it easier
        for tiny home villages to provide affordable housing. However, certain towns aren’t as tolerating as others.
        The state’s capital, Carson City, is the biggest problem that tiny house owners face. Las Vegas is currently the least accepting when
        it comes to tiny houses. What could influence a change is the fact that the city is experiencing a growing affordable housing shortage,
        which Las Vegas may be able to help solve with tiny house units. As state legislature moves forward proposing a statewide change in
        tiny home policies and standards, Las Vegas is likely to assimilate the tiny home lifestyle to help improve its housing.</p>
        <h2 class="headline headline--blue">What Defines a Tiny Home?</h2>
        <p>A tiny home is any residence home that measures less than 400 square feet in floor area. Some are permanently fixed in
          place, while others are more mobile and can travel across the country as long as they meet state regulations regarding recreational
          vehicles. These homes are ultimately much more versatile than traditional houses and can provide homeowners with many options that
          aren’t available otherwise. Homes equipped with all the amenities of a regular sized home.</p>

            <h2 class="headline headline--blue">Our Thoughts...</h2>
            <p>As a growing number of people are looking for ways to lower the costs of living, they’re turning to tiny homes to meet their needs.
              These smaller houses can provide all of the necessities and comfort of traditional home living while remaining more cost-effective.
              We are hoping to move Nevada towards a more modern host for tiny home living.</p>
            <p>We are hoping Las Vegas will be accommodating, with plans to expand the availability of tiny house living across the state following
              new legislature. However, it will likely be several years before you can settle in a tiny home anywhere in the state, which is why
              it’s important to recognize which cities are more open to tiny houses than others.</p>
              <p>Here are the preposed villages for tiny houses in Nevada.</p>

            <h3>Q: Why do Clark County and the City of Las Vegas need Tiny Home Villages?</h3></div>
            <div  class="faq_answer_container">
            <p>While the county and city offer a variety of services to people living on the street, the Clark County Commissioners have declared
              war on the individuals who are still “falling between the cracks,” and services need to be provided on a case-by-case basis. This
              project will help fill gaps in the existing services while also providing an alternative to current interventions that are not able
              to adequately address each individual’s specific needs. (Homelesss youth, LGBTQ+, Veterans, Aging out of the Foster Care System, low-income
              families, etc..)</p></div>

        <div class="faq_question">
      <h3>Q: How did the idea for a village develop?</h3></div>
      <div class="faq_answer_container">
      <p>A working group of concerned community members with wide-ranging expertise laid the foundation for this project by meeting regularly
         in 2019. Initially, a different group envisioned developing a sanctioned tent city on Owens Avenue in a vacant lot, the city
         complained about the hygiene of the group overall. The owner of the property provided porta potties and hand washing stations, but
         the city went out with law enforcement officers, cleared the lot, had the owner remove the porta potties and required the owner to
         fence off the property. So, the individuals moved back to tents along Owens Avenue and under bridges. Then the County Commissioners
         made it illegal to be homeless fining individuals up to $1,000 per incident. So, after much deliberation we have decided to pursue
         our tiny home villages. We are asking for a “Call to Action” from the state legislators to pass legislation because:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>Tiny house regulations and codes may vary by city, town, or county</li>
           <li>Nevada seems fairly welcoming towards tiny houses</li>
           <li>In Clark County, sheds over 200 square feet require a building permit</li>
           <li>ADUs (accessory dwelling units) cannot have kitchen or cooking facilities</li>
           <li>Clark County does not have specific laws or restrictions related to tiny homes, and residential building and zoning regulations,
             but any planned communities are deied by County Commissioners from their own biases</li>

      <h3>Q: Why is an alternative to traditional affordable housing necessary?</h3></div>
      <div class="faq_answer_container">
      <p>All around the country, communities are finding it more and more difficult to secure funding to increase affordable housing.
        Considering the fact that many recently-housed individuals are unable to find employment and/or are able to reintegrate back into
        their community, it is evident that there needs to be a much more holistic approach to stabilizing these individuals and helping them
        become self-sustainable. Our Tiny Home Villages hopes to accomplish this by integrating services, employment, education,
        transportation, and housing all on a single site.</p></div>

          <p>As mentioned previously, our Villages will be managed by an on-site manager and depending on the needs of the community other
            supporting personnel. Also, as appropriate given their physical condition, each resident will be given “chores” to perform that
            ensure the Village is maintained, such as picking up trash in common areas, pulling weeds etc. Residents will be invited to the
            governing council and work together to ensure the Village is maintained. Our non-profit, as the owner, is ultimately responsible
            for maintaining the property.</p></div>

            <p>It is difficult to be specific about property values because our Tiny Home Villages will be the first communities of its kind
              in Las Vegas. We believe that solid architectural design and construction, proper operation and maintenance, and establishing

              that property values are not negatively impacted by our Tiny Home Villages. With the plan of taking over abandoned weekly
              trailer parks, RV parks, or other properties around town we are hoping to bring up property values.</p></div>
